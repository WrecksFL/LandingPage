# LandingPage

First day - I added all base HTML required before styling besides some small classes I'd add later on

Second day - I hammered through the CSS and FlexBox utilities to the best of my ability and learned a lot on the way about using widths to keep everything evenly lined up through different section and containers. Also drastically improved my understanding of containers and other major FlexBox utilities I was struggling with a bit before. Stopped directly before the quote as that was about halfway and was two and a half hours of work and decided to sleep on the quote, CTA (call to action), and footer to rest my brain and think of ways to go about it.

Third day - I spent the last hour needed tidying up some classes to help keep things a bit more organized (Clearly need to work on that a lot, however I like to leave some things in so I can see how much my skills and understanding change down the line, rather than constantly refactoring simple sites such as these!). However, I finished the quote and aligned the author's name to the right below it, did the CTA and aligned the main header and p text to the center left, and aligned the button in the middle of the two and to the right after some thinking using FlexBox. Afterwards all that was left was the footer and obviously, it's a footer.
